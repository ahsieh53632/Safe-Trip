# Functinoality:
  - Login/Register: You will need to register the first time, and it should automaticaly log you in after that
  - scan QRCODE: Don't need to open any website or install any apps, just scan it with your builtin camera and our website will make api calls automatically
    - ###### Since our backend is currently running on LocalHost, if you wish to test this check our guide bellow
      - Encounters/Uber: will show you if this individual may have the virus, and store this encounter to our database
      - Places: will store data in our database that indicates you've been to this location at the specific date
  - AtRisk: will show when and where you have encountered infected individuals or the place you both have went (不會顯示染病者個人資訊)
  - MyQRCODE: Generate your personal QRCODE to allow others to scan
    - ###### Note: updating you're condition (i.e. if you're infected or atRist) will only be possibe via a doctor, also through scanning a QRCODE
  - UpdateInfo: Updating your personal info (name, phone, address etc.)
  - AddID: allow user to store data to our database for situations where you can't scan QRCODE or running the web on a computer
    - ###### Note: currently we have only finished the front end part, not linked to api yet
  - Alert: will show an alert on home page if you are at risk
  - MainPage: MainPage
  - ViewInfo: view personal info

## Places:
 - 前往 /scanCode?info={"type": "beento", "locationid": "location id (stored on database)", "date": "the date"}
